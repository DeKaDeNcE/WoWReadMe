	<p><font class="small_header_blue">What To Do if Your Authentication Key is Missing:</font>
	If you are certain that there is no Authentication Key sticker anywhere on the game materials, immediately return your copy of World of Warcraft to the store where it was purchased, and exchange it for a different copy.<br><br>
	
	A copy of the game that is missing an Authentication Key is defective, the same as if it is missing a disk or manual, and it should be exchanged immediately.<br><br>
	
	If the store is unable or unwilling to replace a copy of the game that is missing an Authentication Key, please hold onto your original receipt and please contact our Billing and Account Services team through <a href="http://www.wow-europe.com/en/support/webform/" class="menubox_header_white" target="_blank">our webform</a>.

	<p><font class="small_header_blue">What to Do if Your Authentication Key Is Invalid:</font>
	Double-check the key you are typing into the web form, and make sure it matches the one on the Authentication Key sticker.<br><br>
	
	If you are certain that you have typed in the key properly, but it still does not work, take your copy of World of Warcraft back to the store where it was purchased.  If the Authentication Key is defective, the whole product is defective, and it should be exchanged at the place of purchase immediately.<br><br>
	
	If the store is unable or unwilling to replace a copy of the game that is missing an Authentication Key, please hold onto your original receipt and please contact our Billing and Account Services team through <a href="http://www.wow-europe.com/en/support/webform/" class="menubox_header_white" target="_blank">our webform</a>.
