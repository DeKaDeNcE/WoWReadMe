			Contacting Technical Support (Mac)
		</a>		
        <p class="normal">There are a variety of resources available to you if you are having problems with your game. Remember, while Game Support exists to provide assistance with the operation of the game and understanding of game functions, Technical Support is intended to assist with matters of program failure. Technical Support cannot assist with gameplay-related questions.</p>

        <p class="normal"><font class="small_header_blue">Support Online:&nbsp;</font>Technical Support for World of Warcraft can be reached through 
        <a href="http://www.wow-europe.com/en/support/" class="menubox_header_white" target="_blank">the support website</a>. Support is available Monday-Friday weekly. We do operate other email addresses to support our other Blizzard titles, but we recommend that you use this address for the fastest service. 
        </p>
        <p class="normal">If you are experiencing a crash or gross program failure, you should attach certain files to the email describing the problem. Please include with your email any text files in the "World of Warcraft\Errors" and "World of Warcraft\Logs" folder. We will also need a copy of your Apple System Profiler.</p>
        <p class="normal">The Apple System Profiler is a tool Apple includes with the Mac OS.  In Mac OS X, the program is in the Utilities folder, which is in the Applications folder on your hard drive. To generate a report from the Apple System Profiler application, select the "Save As" item in the File menu.</p>
