			Contacting Technical Support (PC)
		</a>		
        <p>There are a variety of resources available to you if you are having problems with your game. Remember, while Game Support exists to provide assistance with the operation of the game and understanding of game functions, Technical Support is intended to assist with matters of program failure. Technical Support cannot assist with gameplay-related questions.</p>
	        
        
        <p><a name="Email"></a><font class="small_header_blue">Support Online:&nbsp;</font>Technical Support for World of Warcraft can be reached through 
        <a href="http://www.wow-europe.com/en/support/" class="menubox_header_white" target="_blank">the support website</a>. Support is available Monday-Friday weekly. We do operate other email addresses to support our other Blizzard titles, but we recommend that you use this address for the fastest service. 
        </p>
        <p>If you are experiencing a crash or gross program failure, you should attach certain files to the email describing the problem. Please include with your email any text files in the "World of Warcraft\Errors" and "World of Warcraft\Logs" folder. We will also need two diagnostic files: your dxdiag.txt and msinfo.txt. To obtain the files, follow the instructions below:</p>
        <p>Important Note: Please reboot your system prior to creating the dxdiag and msinfo files.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Click on "Start".
            <li>Click on "Run".
            <li>Type in "dxdiag" and press "Enter" or click "OK". This will open the DirectX diagnostic tool. Run the DirectDraw,Direct3Dand DirectSound tests found under the Display and Sound tabs before creating the dxdiag.txt file.
            <li>Click the "Save All Information" button (save this file to your Windows desktop and name it dxdiag).
            <li>Click the More Help tab and open the Microsoft system information tool (MSInfo).
            <li>Click "File" and choose "Export" (save this file to your Windows desktop as a text file and name it MSInfo). Please make sure to save this file as a .txt file and NOT as a .nfo file.
            <li>Attach the "dxdiag.txt" and "msinfo.txt" files to a reply to this email. 
        </ol>
     
        <p>*Special MSInfo instructions for Windows 2000 users:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Create your dxdiag.txt file as explained above.
            <li>Now choose the More Help tab.
