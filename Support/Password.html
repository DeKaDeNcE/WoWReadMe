        <p><font class="small_header_blue">Changing your password:</font>
        To change your password, login to the <a href="http://www.wow-europe.com/en" class="menubox_header_white" target="_new"> World of Warcraft website</a> and enter your account name and current password to login.  Once you are logged in, click the "Change Password" link and input your new password information.  Once the password change is finalized, it is effective immediately for logging into the game servers.
        
        <p><font class="small_header_blue">Recovering a lost password:</font>
        If you have lost or forgotten your World of Warcraft account password, please go to our <a href="http://www.wow-europe.com/en/" class="menubox_header_white" target="_new">password retrieval web page</a>. Once there, provide the account name, the secret question, AND the answer that you registered the account with.

        <p>If you are experiencing difficulty retrieving your account password, please contact billing support through our <a href="http://www.wow-europe.com/en/support/webform/" class="menubox_header_white" target="_blank">support webform</a>.</p>
        
        <p><font class="small_header_blue">Password Security:</font>        
        The following are some handy steps we recommend to ensure that your password is as safe as possible:
 
        <ul>
            <li>Make sure your password does not contain words from ANY dictionary (forwards or backwards). 
            <li>Use letters, numbers, AND symbols. Simply adding a string of numbers at the end of the password may not be enough to guarantee security.
            <li>Do not use any keyboard sequences (e.g., qwerty).
            <li>Do not use your real name, account name, character names, or any variations thereof.
            <li>Avoid repeating small sequences of characters (e.g., abcabc).
        </ul>
