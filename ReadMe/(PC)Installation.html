	<p>If you have the Beta version of World of Warcraft Installed on your computer, please uninstall it before attempting to install the retail version.
	
	<p>To install World of Warcraft, please place disk one into your CD-ROM drive.   If your computer is AutoPlay-capable, a World of Warcraft splash screen will appear. Select "Install World of Warcraft" from the list and follow the on-screen instructions. If your computer is not AutoPlay-capable, open the "My Computer" icon found on your desktop or in the menu reached by clicking your "Start" button. Then open the drive letter that corresponds to your CD-ROM drive, double-click the "Install" icon, and follow the on-screen instructions. Once disk one has completed installing, you will be prompted to remove disc one from your CD-ROM drive and replace it with disc two and so on until you have installed all four discs.
        <p class="normal">* Please make sure you have 6 gigabytes of free space on your hard drive.
