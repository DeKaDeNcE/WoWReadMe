			From the Developers

        <p class="normal">Thank you for purchasing World of Warcraft. We are extremely pleased to bring you this latest chapter in the Warcraft saga. Longtime fans of the series will recall that this story began as the struggle between Orcs and Humans. Now we expand the tale to encompass the conflict between Trolls and Elves, Gnomes and Goblins, Dwarves and Tauren, Demons and Undead. For the first time in the series, you will control a single character, and from this new perspective, personally help determine the result of this world conflict.</p>
		
		<p class="normal">World of Warcraft represents several years of development, and is by far our biggest game to date. Our Macintosh fans know that Blizzard remains committed to gaming on the Macintosh platform. Our Mac team has spent a great deal of time ensuring a solid release for Macintosh systems, and we are proud to have another simultaneous dual-platform launch.</p> 
        
        <p class="normal">It has been a long time in coming, and we are excited to share this newest endeavor with our fans. With great pride we now throw open the gates to the world of Azeroth, and invite you to join either the vicious Horde or the noble Alliance--to forge your own Warcraft story.</p>
