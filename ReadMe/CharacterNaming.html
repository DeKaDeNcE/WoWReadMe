        <p class="normal">When you finish designing the appearance of your character, it will be time to name your character. This handle will be unique to you on the realm your character resides in. Your character will keep this name for the rest of its playing career, so make sure that you create a moniker that you can live with.</p>
        <p class="normal">Be aware that we do have naming rules: you do not want to risk having to rename your character or incur other penalties. You may not use any unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, hateful, racially offensive, ethnically offensive, or otherwise objectionable language in your name. All such language is inappropriate in conversation, in the naming of characters/guilds/pets, or in any custom content. For more information, you can read our detailed naming policy at
