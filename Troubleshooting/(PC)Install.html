			Installation Problems (PC)
		</a>		
        
        <p>If you encounter any errors while installing World of Warcraft, please check your CDs to verify that they are clean and scratch-free.  Even the smallest scratch or bit of dirt can prevent your CD-ROM drive from reading the disk.  If your disks are clean and scratch-free, please try the steps below to see if they resolve your error.</p>
      
        <p><span class="small_header_blue">1. Shut down any background or antivirus programs:</span> Antivirus applications can interfere with installers on some computers.  Please shut down all antivirus applications and try running in a  <a href="http://www.blizzard.com/support/wow/?id=aww0558p" class="menubox_header_white" target="_new">selective startup</a> to see if you are able to complete your installation successfully.</p>
        <p><span class="small_header_blue">2. Try the disk in a new drive:</span> If you have another CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive in your computer, try inserting the disk into that drive to see if you can successfully install the game from it.  Some drives are able to read damaged disks more easily than others.</p>
        <p><span class="small_header_blue">3. Contact Blizzard Entertainment:</span> If you are still receiving errors during the installation of World of Warcraft and you are unable to complete the installation, please <a href="../Support/(PC)TechnicalSupport.html" class="menubox_header_white">contact Technical Support</a> for further instructions.</p>
