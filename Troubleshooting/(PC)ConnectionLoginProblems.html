			Connection and Login Problems (PC)
		</a>		
        <p class="normal">Please keep in mind that the game servers may be unavailable for short periods of time to accommodate updates, maintenance, and reboots. Prolonged connection problems, however, should be reported to 
        <a href="../Support/(PC)TechnicalSupport.html" class="menubox_header_white">Technical Support.</a>
        </p>
        <p class="normal"><font class="small_header_blue">1. Login errors:&nbsp;</font>If you encounter errors related to connection failure when attempting to log in, you should check our <a href="http://www.wow-europe.com/en/forums/" class="menubox_header_white"  target="_new">Server Status Forum</a> to see if there is a scheduled period of unavailability. You may also want to check the <a href="http://www.wow-europe.com/en/forums/" class="menubox_header_white"  target="_new">Technical Support Forum</a> to see if other users are experiencing the same problem. If your connection problem does not resolve after a few minutes, you should <a href="../Support/(PC)TechnicalSupport.html" class="menubox_header_white">contact Technical Support</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="normal"><font class="small_header_blue">2. After installation, patch installation never starts or is interrupted:&nbsp;</font>: It is possible that the patch server is down or temporarily overloaded. This is more likely following the release of a major new patch. You can try patching at another time.</p>
        <p class="normal">You should also temporarily disable any antivirus software you may have running. Antivirus programs scan files as they are downloading, and this scanning can cause delays that will stall the download process.</p>
        <p class="normal">Finally, make sure that any firewall or security software you have is allowing World of Warcraft unrestricted access to the Internet. Blizzard Entertainment offers a <a href="http://www.blizzard.com/support/wow/?id=aww0423p" class="menubox_header_white" target="_new">Networking Help</a> page for the benefit of our customers, but Blizzard Entertainment is unable to assist with the configuration of firewalls, routers, or network configurations beyond what is on this page. Please contact the manufacturer of your individual hardware/software components for further assistance.</p>
        <p class="normal">Port Information for World of Warcraft: 
        <br>Make sure you have the following ports open for gaming.
        <ul>
        <li>3724
        <li>8086
        <li>8087 
        <li>9081
        <li>9090
        <li>9091
        <li>9100
        </ul></p>

        <p class="normal"><font class="small_header_blue">3. After applying a patch, the game restarts and attempts to patch again, in an endless loop:&nbsp;</font>This problem is regularly found to be caused by the presence of viruses and adware on the installing computer. Check your system for viral software.</p>
        <p class="normal"><font class="small_header_blue">4. Password loss and account maintenance:&nbsp;</font>The World of Warcraft beta offers password recovery. Visit 
        <a href="http://www.wow-europe.com/en" class="menubox_header_white" target="_new">http://www.wow-europe.com/en</a> and utilize the recovery feature selectable from the menu in the upper-right corner of the page. If you need further maintenance on your account, such as a change to the associated email address or the resolution of account theft, please contact our 
        <a href="../Support/AccountAdministration.html" class="menubox_header_white">Accounts Team</a>. 
        </p>

        <p class="normal"><font class="small_header_blue">5. Latency and lag:&nbsp;</font>One obstacle to smooth gameplay is latency, or slowdown of the communications between your computer and the World of Warcraft server. This slowing of transmissions will cause a "lag" between when you execute a command in the game and when the result appears on your screen. This may appear similar to the slowdown your computer experiences when there is a difficult set of calculations to be performed, but in that case the problem is with the performance of your computer, and in this case the issue is with your Internet or network connection.</p>
        <p class="normal">Most often, if the slowdown you are experiencing is due to latency, you will see this reflected in the latency meter built into the command bar at the bottom of the screen. Three bars there change color as the quality of your connection improves or worsens, and you can see an exact measurement of latency if you let your cursor hover over the indicator. As a rule of thumb, less than 100 milliseconds is good latency (If you are using a dial-up modem, you may expect higher latency). If your latency is consistently poor, you may want to contact Technical Support for more information on improving your connection.</p>

        <p class="normal"><font class="small_header_blue">6. In-game disconnections:&nbsp;</font> There are a number of errors and Internet hiccups that could cause a sudden disconnection while mid-game. However, if you consistently face disconnections when performing certain game interactions, like talking to vendors or turning in quests, you may have a technical problem. These disconnections are traditionally found to be related to network communication failure. Start by making sure that your network card is using the latest available drivers. As a test, temporarily disable your firewall. Try simplifying your connection to the Internet to see if the problem is diminished. If nothing helps, please contact <a href="../Support/(PC)TechnicalSupport.html" class="menubox_header_white">Technical Support.</p>
